# Getting Started with Data Science - Introduction

## Introduction

In this section, you will learn about fundamental principles and tools used by data scientists. This section is light on labs, and heavy on reading.  All of the reading lesson are high priority.  They will help frame how you think about the data science process, data ethics, and writing good Python code. 

There are also setup instructions for the essential tools that you will use throughout the program.  Configuring these tools can be tricky, so read the directions carefully.  Setting them up correctly the first time will save you time and frustration later in the course.  

## Professional Data Science Environment Setup

So far, all of your lessons have been completed in a cloud environment that "just works". You open a lesson and are immediately able to run through your own copy of the code without worrying about where the code came from, how it is stored, whether you have the appropriate software downloaded, etc.

This is very convenient for educational purposes, but is not very representative of a real-world data science environment. So, in the second half of this section, we show you how to get all of the tools set up so that your computer has a professional data science environment!

The tools we cover in this section include:

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Anaconda
* Git
* GitHub

You have actually already been using all of these tools "under the hood", but these lessons will walk through what they are all used for and how to install and use them on your computer.

## Appendix

Once you have finished reading about data science fundamentals and set up your tools, move on to the appendix.  There you will find a lab and a lesson which walk you through using the terminal to launch a Jupyter Notebook on a local server.  You will be able to complete the Jupyter content of Canvas via Illumidesk.  However, when you move to projects, you will need to be able to work locally.  If you don't get to the appendix material by the end of the day, make a note to review this content before the beginning of a project week. 

## Summary

Remember, it's okay to feel a little uncomfortable. We are going to throw a lot of new concepts at you, and some of them won't fully make sense until much further down the line. Remember that you'll continue to practice these day after day, until they become second nature!
